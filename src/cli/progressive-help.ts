Start with a reviewable GitHub integration plan:
  lexrunner weave discover --json                          Read open PRs from GitHub
  lexrunner weave plan --from-github --output plan.json --json
                                                          Read GitHub and write the plan file
  lexrunner schema validate plan.json --json               Validate the saved plan
  lexrunner weave merge-order plan.json --json              Inspect dependency order
  lexrunner gate run plan.json --dry-run --json              Preview gates without running them

Choose an unused plan filename. Inspect selected heads, dependencies and executable
gate commands. Preview may write local diagnostics; it proves neither passed gates
nor review or merge authority. Later gate execution runs commands; weave apply
--execute changes Git state and requires separate review and explicit authority.

Plan and carry out authored work:
  lexrunner idea --help             Capture an idea; normal execution may create GitHub issues
  lexrunner create-project --help   Build a work plan; may write files and create issues
  lexrunner attempt --help          Materialize selected work, prepare, attach, submit and verify
Selection and materialization do not launch workers. Preparation changes workspace
and lifecycle state; the assisted host owns actual worker launch and dispatch.
Completion requires evidence and reassessment against success criteria.

Explore further:
  lexrunner --help-all              All command families, aliases, diagnostics and recovery
  lexrunner <command> --help        Full help for that command, including nested operations
  lexrunner workspace --help        Setup and environment diagnostics
