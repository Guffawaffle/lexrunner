# Read-only agent evaluation

Use this evaluation before installing LexRunner or adding it to a repository. Its purpose is to
answer whether LexRunner belongs in the normal workflow, not to manufacture an adoption case.

## Safety boundary

The evaluation is read-only. The agent may inspect supplied files and run non-mutating repository
queries such as `git status`, `git branch --show-current`, `git log`, `git remote -v`, and existing
tool `--help` or `--version` commands. It must not:

- install a package or change a lockfile;
- create or edit files, plans, branches, worktrees, commits, tags, or stashes;
- call a mutating GitHub, issue, PR, release, package, or messaging API;
- push, merge, publish, authenticate, or request broader credentials; or
- execute repository-defined gates or scripts without separate approval.

If evidence is unavailable without one of those actions, record the uncertainty instead of
crossing the boundary.

## Evidence to inspect

1. **Workflow shape:** PR volume, concurrent branches, dependency ordering, integration branches,
   release cadence, and frequency of conflict or sequencing problems.
2. **Existing automation:** CI, merge queues, dependency bots, task runners, agent tools, and any
   current plan/gate/evidence system. Identify overlap instead of assuming replacement.
3. **Authority:** who may run code, create branches, push, open PRs, merge, publish, access secrets,
   and operate external services. Note which LexRunner layer would need each lane.
4. **Platform constraints:** Node/runtime policy, Windows/WSL/native boundaries, containers,
   self-hosted runners, network restrictions, and worktree support.
5. **Operational cost:** package access, configuration ownership, plan review, gate duration,
   artifact retention, support burden, and migration work.
6. **Evidence quality:** what is directly observed, what is inferred, what is stale, and what cannot
   be established read-only.

## Decision rubric

- **`adopt`** — dependency-aware multi-PR integration is routine, existing automation has a clear
  gap, authority is understood, and the maintenance cost is proportionate.
- **`pilot`** — there is a plausible fit, but one bounded repository/workflow trial is needed to
  validate overlap, cost, platform behavior, or authority.
- **`defer`** — the need may exist later, but a prerequisite such as runtime migration, package
  access, CI ownership, or workflow stabilization is missing now.
- **`not a fit`** — the repository lacks the concurrency/integration problem, existing automation
  already solves it with lower cost, or required authority/platform constraints conflict with the
  operating model.

## Required response

Return this compact report:

```yaml
decision: adopt | pilot | defer | not a fit
confidence: high | medium | low
fit:
  observed_problem: "..."
  useful_layers: [plan, merge-weave, evidence, fanout, assisted-agent-work]
overlap:
  existing_automation: ["..."]
  replace_or_complement: "..."
authority:
  currently_available: [read-repo, read-github]
  separately_required_for_trial: [write-local-plan]
  separately_required_for_adoption: [run-gates, push, open-pr, merge]
operational_cost:
  setup: low | medium | high
  recurring: low | medium | high
  notes: "..."
platform_constraints: ["..."]
uncertainty:
  - claim: "..."
    missing_evidence: "..."
smallest_reversible_trial:
  scope: "one repository, one frozen plan, dry-run only"
  preconditions: ["explicit approval to install", "explicit approval to write plan.json"]
  success_signal: "dependency order and gate preview add useful evidence"
  rollback: "remove the local package/config/artifact; no push or merge"
```

The recommendation must explain why the trial is smaller than full adoption and which new approval
would be required to run it. Do not convert a read-only evaluation into the trial automatically.
