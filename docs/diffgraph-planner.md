## Introduction

### What is Diffgraph Planning?

Diffgraph planning automatically discovers dependencies between pull requests and computes an optimal merge order. Instead of manually tracking which PRs depend on which, the planner:

1. **Parses explicit dependencies** from PR descriptions (e.g., `Depends-on: #123`)
2. **Analyzes file changes** to suggest implicit dependencies
3. **Validates the dependency graph** for cycles and orphans
4. **Computes merge layers** using topological sort
5. **Generates a deterministic plan** for execution

**Result:** A validated, executable plan that merges PRs in the correct order, respecting dependencies.

### When to Use Auto-Discovery vs Manual Planning

| Scenario | Recommended Approach | Why |
|----------|---------------------|-----|
| **Small team (2-5 devs)** | Auto-discovery with review | Fast, catches missed dependencies |
| **Large team (10+ devs)** | Explicit deps + suggestions | Better control, human oversight |
| **Complex feature stacks** | Hybrid (both) | Combines precision with discovery |
| **Independent hotfixes** | Manual planning | No dependencies to discover |
| **Batch refactors** | Auto-discovery | File overlap is reliable signal |

### High-Level Workflow

## Quick Start

This minimal example shows how to generate and execute a plan for 3 PRs with dependencies.

### Setup: PRs with Dependencies

You have 3 open PRs:

- **PR-100:** `feature/auth-api` - Add authentication API endpoints
- **PR-101:** `feature/auth-ui` - Add authentication UI (depends on API)
- **PR-102:** `feature/auth-tests` - Add E2E tests (depends on UI)

### Step 1: Add Dependency Footers

Update PR descriptions with explicit dependencies:

**PR-101 description:**
```markdown
Add authentication UI components.

Depends-on: #100
```

**PR-102 description:**
```markdown
Add E2E tests for authentication flow.

Depends-on: #101
```

### Step 2: Generate Plan

```bash
# Set GitHub token (if not already in environment)
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here

# Generate plan from GitHub PRs
lex-pr plan --from-github --output plan.json
```

**Expected output:**
```
✓ Fetched 3 open PRs
✓ Parsed dependencies: 2 explicit, 0 implicit
✓ Validated: no cycles, no orphans
✓ Generated plan: 3 nodes, 2 edges, 3 layers

Plan written to: plan.json
```

### Step 3: Review Plan

```bash
# Show merge order
lex-pr merge-order plan.json
```

**Expected output:**
```
📊 Merge order for 3 items:

Layer 0 (ready):
  → PR-100 (auth-api)

Layer 1 (after PR-100):
  → PR-101 (auth-ui)

Layer 2 (after PR-101):
  → PR-102 (auth-tests)
```

### Step 4: Execute

```bash
# Run gates and merge (dry-run first)
lex-pr merge --plan plan.json

# Execute for real
lex-pr merge --plan plan.json --execute
```

**What happens:**
1. PR-100 gates run → merge
2. PR-101 gates run → merge (after PR-100)
3. PR-102 gates run → merge (after PR-101)

## Dependency Syntax Reference

The planner recognizes multiple dependency formats in PR descriptions.

### Supported Keywords

| Keyword | Example | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| `Depends-on:` | `Depends-on: #123` | **Recommended** - explicit dependency |
| `Depends:` | `Depends: #123, #456` | Alias for `Depends-on:` |
| `Requires:` | `Requires: #123` | Alias for `Depends-on:` |
| `Closes:` | `Closes: #100` | GitHub keyword (not a dependency) |
| `Fixes:` | `Fixes: #200` | GitHub keyword (not a dependency) |
| `Resolves:` | `Resolves: #300` | GitHub keyword (not a dependency) |

**Note:** `Closes`, `Fixes`, and `Resolves` are GitHub issue-closing keywords and are **not treated as dependencies** by the planner.

### Single Dependency

```markdown
Depends-on: #123
```

### Multiple Dependencies

```markdown
Depends-on: #123, #456, #789
```

or split across lines:

```markdown
Depends-on: #123
Depends-on: #456
Depends-on: #789
```

### Cross-Repo References

```markdown
Depends-on: owner/repo#123
Depends-on: other-repo#456
```

**Normalization:** All references are normalized to `owner/repo#number` format internally.

### Invalid Syntax Examples

❌ **Don't do this:**

```markdown
# Missing PR number
Depends-on: feature-branch

# Using PR- prefix (not needed)
Depends-on: PR-123

# Using URLs (not supported)
Depends-on: https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
```

✅ **Do this instead:**

```markdown
Depends-on: #123
```

### Placement in PR Description

Dependencies can appear **anywhere** in the PR description:

```markdown
## Summary
Add new feature X.

## Dependencies
Depends-on: #100, #101

## Changes
- Feature implementation
- Tests added
```

The parser extracts all `Depends-on:` lines regardless of position.

---

## File-Change Heuristics

When explicit dependencies are missing, the planner uses file-change analysis to suggest implicit dependencies.

### How It Works

1. **Fetch file changes** for each PR (via GitHub API)
2. **Build intersection matrix** - which PRs touch the same files
3. **Calculate confidence scores** based on overlap patterns
4. **Generate suggestions** sorted by confidence (high to low)

### Confidence Scoring Explained

#### Shared File Modifications (0.6 - 1.0)

**Highest confidence** - both PRs modify the same file.

| Pattern | Confidence | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Both modify same file | 1.0 | PR-101 modifies `core.ts`, PR-102 modifies `core.ts` |
| One modifies, one renames | 0.8 | PR-101 modifies `old.ts`, PR-102 renames `old.ts` → `new.ts` |
| Mixed (modify + delete) | 0.6 | PR-101 modifies `utils.ts`, PR-102 deletes `utils.ts` |

**Heuristic:** If two PRs modify overlapping files, they likely have a dependency relationship.

#### Directory Proximity (0.3 - 0.8)

**Medium confidence** - PRs work in the same area of the codebase.

```
Formula: min(commonDirs / totalDirs, 0.8)
```

| Scenario | Confidence | Example |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| All files in same directory | 0.8 | Both modify files only in `src/planner/` |
| Majority overlap | 0.6 | 3/5 directories in common |
| Partial overlap | 0.4 | 1/3 directories in common |
| Minimal overlap | 0.3 | Different directories, same parent |

**Heuristic:** PRs working in the same module/directory often have dependencies.

#### Test Overlap (0.5 - 0.85)

**Medium-high confidence** - PRs test the same modules.

| Pattern | Confidence | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Shared test file | 0.85 | Both modify `tests/core.spec.ts` |
| Same module tested | 0.65 | PR-101: `tests/core.spec.ts`, PR-102: `tests/core.test.ts` |
| Related test files | 0.5 | Both modify tests in `tests/api/` |

**Heuristic:** If PRs test the same module, their implementations may be related.

### When to Trust Implicit Dependencies

✅ **High confidence (≥0.7)** - likely a real dependency:
- Both PRs modify the same critical file (`core.ts`, `schema.ts`)
- Extensive file overlap (5+ files)
- Test files overlap suggests implementation dependency

⚠️ **Medium confidence (0.4-0.7)** - requires human review:
- Partial file overlap (1-3 files)
- Directory proximity but different concerns
- Test overlap but different features

❌ **Low confidence (<0.4)** - probably coincidence:
- Minimal file overlap
- Common utility files (`utils.ts`, `types.ts`)
- Documentation changes

### When to Add Explicit Dependencies

Even with high-confidence suggestions, **always prefer explicit dependencies**:

1. **Clarity:** Human-readable intent in PR descriptions
2. **Determinism:** Explicit deps never change (file-based suggestions can)
3. **Debugging:** Easier to understand why PRs are ordered a certain way
4. **Trust:** Team members understand the relationship

**Best practice:** Use suggestions to **discover** missing dependencies, then **add explicit footers** to PR descriptions.

### Suggestion Output Formats

#### Table Format (Human-Readable)

```bash
lex-pr plan --suggest-deps
```

```
📊 Dependency Suggestions (3 found):

| From   | To     | Confidence | Heuristic          | Reason                              |

| PR-101 | PR-102 | 95%        | shared-files       | shared file modifications           |
| PR-201 | PR-202 | 65%        | test-overlap       | tests for same module               |
| PR-301 | PR-302 | 50%        | directory-proximity| both modify files in 1 common dir   |
```

```

```markdown
## Dependency Suggestions

### High Confidence (≥0.7)

- **PR-101 → PR-102** (95% confidence)
  - Heuristic: shared-files
  - Reason: shared file modifications
  - Files: `src/core.ts`, `src/utils.ts`
  
### Medium Confidence (0.4-0.7)

- **PR-201 → PR-202** (65% confidence)
  - Heuristic: test-overlap
  - Reason: tests for same module
```

---

## Validation & Troubleshooting

The planner validates plans before execution to catch errors early.

### Validation Checks

1. **Cycle detection** - no circular dependencies
2. **Reference validation** - all deps point to valid PRs
3. **Self-dependency check** - no PR depends on itself
4. **Orphan detection** - warn about isolated PRs

### Error: Dependency Cycle Detected

**Symptom:**
```
❌ Validation failed: Dependency cycle detected
Cycle path: PR-100 → PR-101 → PR-102 → PR-100
```

**Cause:** Circular dependency in the graph.

**Diagnosis:**
1. Review the cycle path from the error message
2. Check PR descriptions for circular `Depends-on:` footers
3. Check file overlap (might be false positive from heuristics)

**Solution:**

```bash
# Step 1: Identify the weakest link in the cycle
lex-pr plan --suggest-deps --json | jq '.suggestions[] | select(.from == "PR-100" and .to == "PR-101")'

# Step 2: If the dependency is weak (low confidence), remove it
# Edit PR description, remove "Depends-on: #100"

# Step 3: Regenerate plan
lex-pr plan --from-github --output plan.json
```

**Example fix:**

Before (cycle):
```
PR-100: Depends-on: #102
PR-101: Depends-on: #100
PR-102: Depends-on: #101
```

After (broken cycle):
```
PR-100: (no dependencies)
PR-101: Depends-on: #100
PR-102: Depends-on: #101
```

### Warning: Unreachable/Orphan PRs

**Symptom:**
```
⚠️  Warning: Orphan PRs detected (no dependencies, no dependents)
  - PR-999 (hotfix/security-patch)
```

**Cause:** PR has no dependencies and no other PRs depend on it.

**Is this a problem?**

Sometimes **NO** (valid scenarios):
- Independent hotfixes
- Parallel feature work
- Refactors with no dependencies

Sometimes **YES** (missing dependencies):
- PR should depend on foundation work
- PR is part of a stack but missing `Depends-on:` footer

**Diagnosis:**

```bash
# Check if suggestions exist for the orphan PR
lex-pr plan --suggest-deps | grep "PR-999"
```

**Solution:**

If suggestions exist:
```bash
# Add explicit dependency to PR description
# Edit PR-999, add "Depends-on: #100"
```

If truly independent:
```bash
# Ignore the warning - this is expected
```

### Low-Confidence Implicit Dependencies

**Symptom:**
```
📊 Dependency Suggestions (1 found):
| From   | To     | Confidence | Heuristic          |
|--------|--------|------------|-------------------|
| PR-101 | PR-102 | 35%        | directory-proximity|
```

**Cause:** File overlap is weak, heuristics are uncertain.

**Options:**

1. **Add explicit dependency** (if relationship exists):
   ```markdown
   # In PR-102 description
   Depends-on: #101
   ```

2. **Ignore suggestion** (if PRs are truly independent):
   ```bash
   # Use higher threshold to filter out low-confidence suggestions
   lex-pr plan --suggest-deps --threshold=0.5
   ```

3. **Investigate further**:
   ```bash
   # Get detailed file overlap info
   lex-pr plan --suggest-deps --json | jq '.suggestions[] | select(.confidence < 0.5)'
   ```

### Plan Differs Between Runs

**Symptom:** Running the same command twice produces different output.

**Cause:** This should **never happen** - it's a determinism bug.

**Diagnosis:**

```bash
# Generate plan twice, compare
lex-pr plan --from-github --output plan1.json
lex-pr plan --from-github --output plan2.json
diff plan1.json plan2.json
```

**If different:**
1. Check for timestamp fields (file them as a bug)
2. Check for random ordering (file them as a bug)
3. Check for network timing issues (file them as a bug)

**Workaround:**
```bash
# Pin specific commit SHAs in plan (not yet supported - file a feature request)
```

**Report:** This is a critical bug - please [file an issue](https://github.com/Guffawaffle/LexRunner/issues/new/choose) with:
- Commands run
- Diff of the two plans
- Environment details (OS, Node version, lex-pr version)

## Workflows & Best Practices

Choose the workflow that matches your team's size and trust level.

### Workflow 1: Full Auto (Trust the Planner)

**Best for:** Small teams (2-5 devs), high trust in tooling

```bash
# One-shot: generate and execute
lex-pr plan --from-github --output plan.json
lex-pr execute --plan plan.json
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ **Fast** - minimal overhead
- ✅ **No manual review** - trust heuristics
- ✅ **Catch implicit deps** - discovers missed relationships

**Cons:**
- ❌ **Potential errors** - heuristics can be wrong
- ❌ **Less control** - no human verification
- ❌ **Trust required** - team must trust the planner

**When to use:**
- Small codebase with clear module boundaries
- High test coverage (gates catch integration issues)
- Team is comfortable with automation

### Workflow 2: Review Before Execute

**Best for:** Medium teams (5-10 devs), safety-first culture

```bash
# Step 1: Generate suggestions for review
lex-pr plan --suggest-deps --format=markdown > review.md

# Step 2: Human reviews review.md
#   - Approve high-confidence suggestions
#   - Reject false positives
#   - Add missing explicit dependencies

# Step 3: Update PR descriptions with approved dependencies
# (Manual step: edit PR descriptions in GitHub)

# Step 4: Generate final plan (with updated explicit deps)
lex-pr plan --from-github --output plan.json

# Step 5: Execute
lex-pr execute --plan plan.json
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ **Human oversight** - catches errors early
- ✅ **Learning opportunity** - team understands dependencies
- ✅ **Trust building** - verify heuristics are working

**Cons:**
- ❌ **Slower** - requires review step
- ❌ **Manual updates** - editing PR descriptions
- ❌ **Cognitive load** - reviewing suggestions

**When to use:**
- Medium-sized team with complex dependencies
- High-stakes releases (production deployments)
- Building trust in the planner (early adoption)

### Workflow 3: Hybrid (Explicit + Suggestions)

**Best for:** Large teams (10+ devs), complex repos

```bash
# Step 1: PRs already have some explicit dependencies
# (Team discipline: always add Depends-on: for known deps)

# Step 2: Generate suggestions for missing dependencies
lex-pr plan --suggest-deps --threshold=0.7 > suggestions.md

# Step 3: Review high-confidence suggestions only (≥0.7)
# Add them to PR descriptions

# Step 4: Generate plan (combines explicit + reviewed implicit)
lex-pr plan --from-github --output plan.json

# Step 5: Execute
lex-pr execute --plan plan.json
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ **Best of both worlds** - explicit control + discovery
- ✅ **Scales well** - clear rules for large teams
- ✅ **High confidence** - only trust strong signals

**Cons:**
- ❌ **Requires discipline** - team must add explicit deps
- ❌ **Configuration needed** - threshold tuning
- ❌ **More steps** - review + update cycle

**When to use:**
- Large codebase with many concurrent PRs
- Established team with good practices
- Complex dependency patterns (stacks, diamonds, etc.)

### Best Practices Summary

| Practice | Why | How |
|----------|-----|-----|
| **Prefer explicit deps** | Clarity and determinism | Always add `Depends-on:` when known |
| **Use high thresholds** | Filter noise | `--threshold=0.7` for hybrid workflow |
| **Review suggestions** | Catch errors | Generate `review.md` before execution |
| **Test heuristics** | Build trust | Compare suggestions to ground truth |
| **Document decisions** | Team alignment | Add comments in PR descriptions |
| **Validate early** | Catch cycles | Run `plan --validate` before execution |
| **Commit plans** | Reproducibility | Store `plan.json` in version control |

## Advanced Topics

### Custom Scoring Weights

Adjust the weights for different heuristics:

```typescript
import { scoreDependencies } from "./planner/dependencyScoring.js";

const scores = await scoreDependencies(prs, fileAnalyzer, {
  weights: {
    explicit: 1.0,           // Explicit deps always win
    sharedFiles: 0.8,        // Lower weight for file overlap
    directoryProximity: 0.5, // Lower weight for directory proximity
    testOverlap: 0.6         // Medium weight for test overlap
  },
  threshold: 0.5             // Filter out scores below 0.5
});
```

**Use case:** Tune weights based on your codebase characteristics.

### Filtering PRs by Label

```bash
# Only include PRs with specific labels
lex-pr plan --from-github --labels "ready-to-merge,stack:*"

# Exclude PRs with specific labels
lex-pr plan --from-github --exclude-labels "do-not-merge,wip"
```

**Use case:** Focus on a subset of PRs (e.g., only "ready" PRs).

### Excluding Stale PRs

```bash
# Only include PRs updated in the last 7 days
lex-pr plan --from-github --since 7d

# Only include PRs created after a specific date
lex-pr plan --from-github --created-after 2024-01-01
```

**Use case:** Ignore old PRs that are no longer relevant.

### Plan Diffing

Compare two plans to see what changed:

```bash
# Generate plan at two different times
lex-pr plan --from-github --output plan-old.json
# (PRs are updated)
lex-pr plan --from-github --output plan-new.json

# Diff the plans
lex-pr plan-diff plan-old.json plan-new.json
```

**Output:**
```
📊 Plan Diff:

Added PRs:
  + PR-105 (new-feature)

Removed PRs:
  - PR-99 (merged)

Changed dependencies:
  ~ PR-101: added dep on PR-104
```

**Use case:** Understand how plan evolved as PRs are added/merged.

### Incremental Planning

Add new PRs to an existing plan without regenerating:

```bash
# Start with existing plan
lex-pr plan --from-github --output plan.json

# Add a new PR manually
# (Edit plan.json, add new item)

# Validate the updated plan
lex-pr plan --validate plan.json
```

**Use case:** Quick updates without full regeneration.

### `createFileAnalyzer()`

Create a file analyzer for detecting implicit dependencies.

**Module:** `src/planner/fileAnalysis.ts`

**Signature:**
```typescript
function createFileAnalyzer(
  octokit: Octokit,
  owner: string,
  repo: string
): FileAnalyzer
```

**Parameters:**
- `octokit` - Authenticated Octokit instance
- `owner` - Repository owner
- `repo` - Repository name

**Returns:** `FileAnalyzer` instance with methods:
- `getPRFileChanges(prNumber, sha?)` - Fetch file changes for a PR
- `analyzeFiles(prs)` - Perform complete file analysis
- `clearCache()` - Clear the internal cache
- `getCacheStats()` - Get cache statistics

**Example:**
```typescript
import { createFileAnalyzer } from "./planner/fileAnalysis.js";
import { Octokit } from "@octokit/rest";

const octokit = new Octokit({ auth: process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN });
const analyzer = createFileAnalyzer(octokit, "owner", "repo");

const analysis = await analyzer.analyzeFiles([
  { number: 101, name: "PR-101", sha: "abc123" },
  { number: 102, name: "PR-102", sha: "def456" }
]);

console.log("File intersections:", analysis.fileIntersections);
console.log("Suggestions:", analysis.suggestions);
console.log("Conflicts:", analysis.conflicts);
```

## Examples Gallery

Real-world examples demonstrating different dependency patterns.

### Example 1: Simple Stack (Linear)

**Scenario:** 3 PRs building on each other sequentially.

**PRs:**
- PR-100: Add auth API (foundation)
- PR-101: Add auth UI (depends on API)
- PR-102: Add auth tests (depends on UI)

**Dependencies:**
```
PR-100 → PR-101 → PR-102
```

**Plan:**
```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "1.0.0",
  "target": "main",
  "items": [
    { "id": "pr-100", "name": "auth-api", "deps": [] },
    { "id": "pr-101", "name": "auth-ui", "deps": ["auth-api"] },
    { "id": "pr-102", "name": "auth-tests", "deps": ["auth-ui"] }
  ]
}
```

**Merge order:**
```
Layer 0: PR-100
Layer 1: PR-101
Layer 2: PR-102
```

**Tutorial:** [01-simple-stack.md](./tutorials/diffgraph-planner/01-simple-stack.md)

### Example 2: Diamond Pattern (Fan-out/Fan-in)

**Scenario:** UI depends on both auth and API (which are independent).

**PRs:**
- PR-100: Add auth system
- PR-101: Add API endpoints
- PR-102: Add UI (depends on both PR-100 and PR-101)

**Dependencies:**
```
    PR-102 (UI)
    /        \
PR-100    PR-101
(auth)    (API)
```

**Plan:**
```json
{
  "items": [
    { "id": "pr-100", "name": "auth", "deps": [] },
    { "id": "pr-101", "name": "api", "deps": [] },
    { "id": "pr-102", "name": "ui", "deps": ["auth", "api"] }
  ]
}
```

**Merge order:**
```
Layer 0: PR-100, PR-101 (parallel)
Layer 1: PR-102
```

### Example 3: Large Batch (20+ PRs)

**Scenario:** Major refactor with 20 PRs, mixed explicit and implicit dependencies.

**Approach:**
1. Generate suggestions: `lex-pr plan --suggest-deps --threshold=0.7`
2. Review high-confidence suggestions
3. Add explicit deps to PR descriptions
4. Generate final plan: `lex-pr plan --from-github`

**Result:** Complex graph with 5-7 layers, parallel execution within each layer.

**Tutorial:** [03-large-batch.md](./tutorials/diffgraph-planner/03-large-batch.md)

### Example 4: Cycle Error (Before/After Fix)

**Before (error):**
```
PR-100: Depends-on: #102
PR-101: Depends-on: #100
PR-102: Depends-on: #101

❌ Cycle detected: PR-100 → PR-102 → PR-101 → PR-100
```

**Fix:** Remove weakest dependency (PR-100 → PR-102).

**After (valid):**
```
PR-100: (no dependencies)
PR-101: Depends-on: #100
PR-102: Depends-on: #101

✓ Valid: 3 nodes, 2 edges, 3 layers
```

### Example 5: Mixed Explicit + Implicit

**Scenario:** Some PRs have explicit deps, others rely on file-based suggestions.

**PRs:**
- PR-100: Explicit: `Depends-on: #99`
- PR-101: No explicit deps, but modifies same files as PR-100
- PR-102: Explicit: `Depends-on: #101`

**Suggestions:**
```
PR-101 → PR-100 (0.95 confidence, shared files)
```

**Workflow:**
1. Review suggestion
2. Add to PR-101: `Depends-on: #100`
3. Regenerate plan
